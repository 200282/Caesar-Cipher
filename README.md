# Caesar-Cipher
The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique .
It works by shifting the letters in the plaintext message by a certain number of positions 

 H becomes K (shift 3 from H)       
 E becomes H (shift 3 from E)    
 L becomes O (shift 3 from L)       
 L becomes O (shift 3 from L)         
 O becomes R (shift 3 from O)

this is a python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using caesar cipher algorithm . allow users to input a message and a key value to perform encryption and decryption
